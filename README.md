Lizardcd is a lightweight cloud native continuous delivery project, which is a server-agent architecture and support multi-cluster of kubernetes. It's composed of lizardcd-server, lizardcd-agent, lizardcd-ui and lizardcd-cli.

# What is Lizardcd
![](https://project-1255547500.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/lizardcd%2Flizardcd%E6%9E%B6%E6%9E%84%E5%9B%BE.png)
Lizardcd is a cloud native continuous delivery tool for kubernetes. It works in server-agent mode with grpc framework. The agent can run as a `deployment` in one or more kubernetes cluster, or run as an `executed binary package` out of kubernetes with a kubeconfig. The server can run everywhere, as an executed binary package, a docker or a deployment in kubernetes. Lizardcd needs a service registry center for service automatically discovery, now it only supoorts `consul`.

# Features
- Cloud native, server-agent architecture, and agent can run in/out of kubernetes cluster.
- No need of kubeconfig and clusterrole, with In-Cluster mode, agent use a serviceaccount to communicate with kubernetes APIServer.
- Support multi-cluster of kubernetes.
- Agent register and discover automatically by consul.
- Prometheus Metrics and opentelemetry built-in, support monitoring and open tracing.
- Access by lizardcd-ui or lizardcd-cli.

# How lizardcd works
Lizardcd is composed of lizardcd-agent, lizardcd-server, lizardcd-ui and lizardcd-cli.

- lizardcd-agent: Agent use kubernetes `client-go` SDK to communited with kubernetes APIServer. It listens on a grpc port, and wait of requests from server. The agent will register itself to `consul` with a key of `lizardcd-agent.<namespace>.<cluster>` when it starts, please do not change the format of the key. The agent is stateless and can be scaled out with many replicas.

  Attention: if the agent run in a kubernetes pod, it will defaultly register to consul with the address of the `pod IP`, which may not be connected from a server, so you must specify the startup params with `--register.endpoint`, which points to your agent service `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`.

- lizardcd-server: Server will `watch` the `consul` services and store all agent service connections in itself, when it received a RESTAPI requests with kubernetes cluster/namespace information, it will take a connection from agent services and communicated with this agent throw grpc.

- lizardcd-ui: A web ui for lizardcd-server, simply supported list/patch/delete/rollout-restart/scale workloads for devops.

- lizardcd-cli: A command-line tool, which has colorful table-format output.

# Why is Lizardcd
For many other CD tools for kubernetes, like argocd, kubevela, which are often agentless, must interactive with kubernetes with a `kubeconfig`. In many cases, you don't have a `kubeconfig`, you don't know the apiserver's address, may be you are using a dashboard of kubernetes, like kubesphere or rancher, and you are just a namespace's user of kubernetes. Lizardcd can run with a `In-Cluster` mode, it is deployed as a `deployment` and use a `serviceaccount` with a role of it's rolebinding. For example, if you want to use lizardcd to set a `image` of a workload, you just need a role with `apiGroups: apps` and `resources: deployments` and `verbs: update`.

Lizardcd supports multi-cluster of kubernetes, one agent for a cluster, if the agent has a cluster scope role of serviceaccount or kubeconfig. Also you can deploy many agents in a cluster and one for a namespace, if you only have a namespace scope role. 

All agents will automatically register to a consul when started, and will automatically deregister when stopped. The server will also automatically discover the agents from consul.

# Installation
We support Binary package, Docker, Kubernetes(Helm charts), you can get binary packages from release pages, and docker images in [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/)


## Linux
Unpack the compressed pacakge:
```shell
tar zxf lizardcd-server-linux-amd64-<version>.tar.gz
tar zxf lizardcd-agent-linux-amd64-<version>.tar.gz
tar zxf lzcli-linux-amd64-<version>.tar.gz
```

Then you can start the agent like this:
```shell
./lizardcd-agent --consul.host 10.50.89.17:8500 --consul.key lizardcd-agent.*.tektonk8s --kubeconfig ~/.kube/config --grpc-addr 0.0.0.0:5017
```

You can start the server like this:
```shell
./lizardcd-server --consul-addr 10.50.89.17:8500 --http-addr=0.0.0.0:5117
```

Then you can use a cli to connect to the server:
```shell
./lzcli config -s http://<lizardcd-server>:5117
./lzcli agent list
```
the config file is defaultly saved to ~/.lizardcd-cli.yaml, you can use `-c` to specified the config file.

## Windows
Unpack the compressed pacakge, and you can start the agent like this:
```powershell
.\lizardcd-agent.exe --consul.host 10.50.89.17:8500 --consul.key lizardcd-agent.*.tektonk8s --kubeconfig ~/.kube/config --grpc-addr 0.0.0.0:5017
```

You can start the server like this:
```powershell
.\lizardcd-server.exe --consul-addr 10.50.89.17:8500 --http-addr=0.0.0.0:5117
```

Then you can use a cli to connect to the server:
```powershell
.\lzcli.exe config -s http://<lizardcd-server>:5117
.\lzcli.exe agent list
```

# Build
